## Setting Up Python

Before you can start coding in Python, you need to install it on your machine.

### 1. Install Python
- **Windows/Mac/Linux:**
  Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the appropriate version for your system. Follow the installation instructions.

  *Important:* Make sure to check the box that says “Add Python to PATH” during installation.

### 2. Install a Code Editor
While you can use any text editor, we recommend using a code editor for a better coding experience. Here are some popular options:

- **VS Code:** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **PyCharm:** [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- **Sublime Text:** [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

### 3. Verify Your Installation
Once Python is installed, open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) and run the following command to verify that Python was successfully installed:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see a version number like `Python 3.x.x`.

## Python Basics

### 1. Variables and Data Types
In Python, you can store data in variables. Python supports various data types, including:

- **int:** Whole numbers (e.g., `5`)
- **float:** Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`)
- **str:** Strings (e.g., `'Hello, World!'`)
- **bool:** Boolean values (`True` or `False`)

Example:
```python
x = 10         # int
y = 3.14       # float
name = "Alice" # str
is_active = True # bool
```

### 2. Basic Operations
Python allows you to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:

```python
a = 10
b = 5

print(a + b)  # Addition
print(a - b)  # Subtraction
print(a * b)  # Multiplication
print(a / b)  # Division
```

### 3. Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your code:

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult!")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

### 4. Loops
Loops let you repeat a block of code multiple times:

```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### 5. Functions
Functions allow you to define reusable blocks of code:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can dive into more advanced topics:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Learn about classes and objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Data Structures**: Master lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Explore popular libraries like NumPy (for data science), Flask/Django (for web development), and TensorFlow (for machine learning).
- **Projects**: Start building your own projects to apply what you've learned.

## FAQs

### 1. Do I need prior programming experience to learn Python?
No, Python is beginner-friendly. If you're new to programming, Python is an excellent starting point!

### 2. Should I learn Python 2 or Python 3?
Always learn Python 3. Python 2 is no longer supported, and Python 3 has more features and improvements.

### 3. How long does it take to learn Python?
This depends on how much time you dedicate to learning and your prior experience. For most beginners, it may take a few months to get comfortable with the language.
